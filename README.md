# LocalizationExport
Set of tools for export locale data for countries to use in Android application

## How to use

1. Get latest version of `countries.json` from https://github.com/mledoze/countries (there is one already provided for convinience)
1. Run `./filter.py countries.json`
1. All exported values can be found in `output/`

Note: The script is named filter, because it basically filters only Europen data from `countries.json`.
